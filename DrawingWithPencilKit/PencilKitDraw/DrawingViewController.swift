Abstract:
`DrawingViewController` is the primary view controller for showing drawings.
*/

///`PKCanvasView` is the main drawing view that you will add to your view hierarchy.
/// The drawingPolicy dictates whether drawing with a finger is allowed.  If it's set to default and if the tool picker is visible,
/// then it will respect the global finger pencil toggle in Settings or as set in the tool picker.  Otherwise, only drawing with
/// a pencil is allowed.

/// You can add your own class as a delegate of PKCanvasView to receive notifications after a user
/// has drawn or the drawing was updated. You can also set the tool or toggle the ruler on the canvas.

/// There is a shared tool picker for each window. The tool picker floats above everything, similar
/// to the keyboard. The tool picker is moveable in a regular size class window, and fixed to the bottom
/// in compact size class. To listen to tool picker notifications, add yourself as an observer.

/// Tool picker visibility is based on first responders. To make the tool picker appear, you need to
/// associate the tool picker with a `UIResponder` object, such as a view, by invoking the method
/// `UIToolpicker.setVisible(_:forResponder:)`, and then by making that responder become the first

/// Best practices:
///
/// -- Because the tool picker palette is floating and moveable for regular size classes, but fixed to the
/// bottom in compact size classes, make sure to listen to the tool picker's obscured frame and adjust your UI accordingly.

/// -- For regular size classes, the palette has undo and redo buttons, but not for compact size classes.
/// Make sure to provide your own undo and redo buttons when in a compact size class.
